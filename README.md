# TB_Detection
# Project Description

Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment and control. This project leverages machine learning and image analysis techniques to assist in the detection of TB from medical images, aiming to support healthcare professionals in diagnosis and research.

The notebooks in this repository guide users through data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps, making it easier to experiment with different approaches and improve detection accuracy.
# TB Detection

This project aims to detect Tuberculosis (TB) using image analysis and machine learning techniques. It includes several Jupyter notebooks for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `dip-d-4-n-merged.ipynb`: Main notebook for merged data analysis and model development.
- `dip-d1-n.ipynb`, `dip-d2-n.ipynb`, `dip-d3-n.ipynb`: Additional notebooks for data exploration and experiments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
	```powershell
	git clone <repo-url>
	```
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Install required Python packages (see below).

## Requirements

Recommended packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow or pytorch (depending on your model)

Install with pip:
```powershell
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

Run the notebooks step by step to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results. Modify parameters as needed for your experiments.
